                        <p><strong>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</strong></p>
                        <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a 
                            great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic 
                            value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT 
                            bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
                            Our advice: spend the weekend <a id="anchor_link" href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by 
                            this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

                        <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk 
                            (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a 
                            total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS 
                            Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text 
                            on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

                            Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling 
                            them, not buying them.
